# 🐳 Docker & Containerisation — From Zero to Orchestration  
### **Volume 1: Docker Foundations**

A **deep, story-driven, engineer-first book** on Docker and containerisation —  
from bare metal history to orchestration, production realities, interviews, and mindset.

This is **not a Docker cheat sheet**.  
This is a **foundational book** designed to help you *think clearly* about containers.

---

## 🎯 What This Book Is About

This book explains **Docker from first principles**:

- Why containers exist
- How Linux makes containers possible
- How Docker actually works under the hood
- How containers behave in production
- Why orchestration becomes inevitable
- How Docker knowledge maps cleanly to Kubernetes
- How senior engineers reason about containers

If you’ve ever felt:
- “Docker works, but I don’t fully get it”
- “Kubernetes feels overwhelming”
- “I can run containers, but can’t debug them”

👉 This book is for you.

## 👥 Who This Book Is For

This book is ideal for:

- Beginners who want **strong fundamentals**
- Working engineers tired of shallow tutorials
- DevOps / SRE aspirants
- Network / Systems engineers moving into containers
- Engineers preparing for **Docker interviews**
- Anyone planning to learn Kubernetes *properly*

📌 No prior Docker expertise required —  
but curiosity and patience are assumed.

---

## 🧠 What Makes This Book Different

✔ Story-driven learning (history → problem → solution)  
✔ Linux-first (namespaces, cgroups, filesystems explained)  
✔ No “Docker magic” explanations  
✔ Real production reasoning  
✔ Clear mental models  
✔ Interview-ready explanations  
✔ Written like a **mentor explaining systems**, not a blog post  

This book focuses on **understanding**, not memorization.

## 📘 Volume Structure (This Repository)

### 📕 **Volume 1 — Docker & Containerisation**

This volume covers Docker **completely**, ending at orchestration.

### Major sections include:
- History of containerisation
- Linux kernel foundations (namespaces, cgroups)
- Docker architecture & runtime internals
- Images, Dockerfiles, and build strategies
- Networking and storage
- Docker Compose and multi-container systems
- Docker Swarm and orchestration concepts
- Production usage (CI/CD, security, performance)
- Interview preparation (beginner → advanced)
- Engineering mindset and principles

📌 Kubernetes is **intentionally NOT included** in this volume.

## 🧭 How to Read This Book

* 📖 Read sequentially for best understanding
* 🧠 Pause and reflect — concepts matter more than speed
* 📝 Use interview chapters independently if needed
* 🛠 Refer back while debugging real Docker issues
* 🎓 Use it to mentor juniors or explain concepts to peers

This book is meant to be **understood**, not rushed.

## 📚 Summary / Table of Contents

The full chapter list is available in:
👉 **`Summary.md`**

## 🧩 What You’ll Be Ready For After This Book

After finishing Volume 1, you will be able to:

* Explain Docker **from kernel to orchestration**
* Debug container failures confidently
* Design containerized systems correctly
* Avoid common Docker anti-patterns
* Perform well in Docker interviews
* Transition smoothly into Kubernetes

You won’t just *use* Docker —
you’ll **understand it**.

---

## 📘 What Comes Next

### 📗 Volume 2 — Kubernetes (Planned)

A separate volume will cover Kubernetes deeply:

* Control plane architecture
* Pods, nodes, services
* Scheduling and controllers
* Storage and networking
* Declarative systems

Docker fundamentals from this volume will be **assumed knowledge**.

---

## ✍️ Author’s Note

This book was written with one belief:

> **If you understand first principles, tools stop being scary.**

Docker is not magic.
Containers are not virtual machines.
And orchestration only makes sense when fundamentals are solid.

If this book helped you think more clearly, it has done its job.

Happy learning 🐳🧠
